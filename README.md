# Attack-on-Tewari-and-Gupta-protocol
Implementation of a Passive Secret Disclosure Attack on an Ultralightweight Authentication Protocol for Internet of Things 

Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology in which for any object the ability to send data via communications networks, is provided. Ensuring the security of Internet services and applications, is an important factor in attracting users to use this platform. In the other words, if people are unable to trust that the equipment and information will be reasonably safe against damage, abuse and the other security threats, this lack of trust leads to a reduction in the use of Internet of Things based applications.
Recently, Tewari  and Gupta have proposed an ultralightweight   RFID authentication protocol[1] to provide desired security for objects in  IoT. In this code, also see [2],  we consider the security of the proposed protocol and present a passive secret disclosure attack against it.  The success probability of the attack is `1' while the complexity of the attack is only eavesdropping one session of the protocol.  The presented attack has negligible complexity. We verify the correctness of the presented attack by this code.
